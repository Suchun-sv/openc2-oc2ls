## Abstract
Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyberdefense via statically configured products operating in isolation is no longer tenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system or enterprise. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. It should be understood that a language such as OpenC2 is necessary but insufficient to enable coordinated cyber response. Other aspects of coordinated cyber response such as sensing, analytics, and selecting appropriate courses of action are beyond the scope of OpenC2.

# 1 Introduction
The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components.

The OpenC2 language defines two message types:

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system,the OpenC2 "Producer", to one or more systems, the OpenC2 "Consumer(s)", to act on the content of the command
2. **Response**: Any information captured or necessary to send back to the invoking system that requested the Command be invoked, i.e., the OpenC2 Consumer response to the OpenC2 Producer.

The components of an OpenC2 Command are an action (what is to be done), a target (what is being acted upon), an optional actuator (what is performing the command), and command options, which influence how the command is to be performed. An action coupled with a target is sufficient to describe a complete OpenC2 Command. The inclusion of an actuator and/or command-options provide additional precision.

Additional detail regarding the TARGET and ACTUATOR may be included to increase the precision of the command. For example, which target (i.e., target specifier), additional information about what is to be performed on a specific target type (i.e., target option), which actuator(s) (i.e., actuator specifier) and/or additional information regarding how a specific actuator executes the action (i.e., actuator option).

An OpenC2 Response is issued as a result of an OpenC2 command. OpenC2 responses are used to provide acknowledgement, status, results of command execution, or other information in conjunction with a particular command.

## 1.1 Goal
> **Editor's Note** - TBSL - This section will be included in a future iteration (probably iteration 5) prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

## 1.2 Purpose and Scope
The OpenC2 Language Specification defines the set of components to assemble a complete command and control message and provides a framework so that the language can be extended. To achieve this purpose, the scope of this specification includes:

1. the set of actions and options that may be used in OpenC2 commands
2. the set of targets, target specifiers, and target options
3. A syntax that defines the structure of commands and responses
4. an organizational scheme that describes an Actuator Profile
5. The MTI serialization of OpenC2 commands, and responses
6. the procedures for extending the language

The OpenC2 language assumes that the event has been detected, a decision to act has been made, the act is warranted, and the initiator and recipient of the commands are authenticated and authorized. The OpenC2 language was designed to be agnostic of the other aspects of cyber defense implementations that realize these assumptions. The following items are beyond the scope of this specification:

1. Language extensions applicable to some actuators
2. Alternate serializations of OpenC2 commands
3. The enumeration of the protocols required for transport, information assurance, sensing, analytics and other external dependencies

## 1.3 IPR Policy
This Working Draft is being developed under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established. For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC's web page (https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php).

## 1.4 Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and [RFC8174].

## 1.5 Document Conventions
> **Editor's Note** - TBSL - This section will be included in a future iteration (probably iteration 5) prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

## 1.6 Naming Conventions
RFC2119/RFC8174 key words (see section 1.4) are in all uppercase.

All property names and literals are in lowercase, except when referencing canonical names defined in another standard (e.g., literal values from an IANA registry). Words in property names are separated with an underscore (_), while words in string enumerations are separated with a hyphen (-). All type names, property names, object names, and vocabulary terms are between three and 250 characters long.

```javascript
{   "action": "contain",
    "target": {
        "user_account": {
            "user_id": "fjbloggs",
            "account_type": "windows-local"
        }
    }
}
```

# 2 OpenC2 Language
## 2.1 Overview
The OpenC2 language has two distinct message types: Command and Response. The OpenC2 Command describes an action performed on a target. The OpenC2 Response is a means to provide information (such as acknowledgement, status, etc.) as a result of an OpenC2 Command.

## 2.2 OpenC2 Command
The OpenC2 Command communicates an action to be performed on a target and may include information identifying the actuator(s) that is to execute the command.

### 2.2.1 Command Structure
An OpenC2 Command has four fields: ACTION, TARGET, ACTUATOR and COMMAND-OPTIONS.

The ACTION and TARGET fields are required and are populated by one of the 'action-types' in Table 2-1 and the 'target-types' in Table 2-2. A particular target-type may be further refined by one or more 'target-specifiers' and/or 'target-options'.

The optional ACTUATOR field identifies the entity or entities that are tasked to execute the OpenC2 Command.

Information with respect to how the action is to be executed is provided with one or more 'actuator-options'.

The optional COMMAND-OPTIONS field is populated by one or more 'command-options' that provide information that influences how the command is executed.

The following list summarizes the fields and subfields of an OpenC2 Command. OpenC2 Commands MUST contain an ACTION and TARGET and MAY contain an ACTUATOR and/or COMMAND-OPTIONS. OpenC2 is agnostic of any particular serialization; however, implementations MUST support JSON serialization of the commands.

* **ACTION** (required): The task or activity to be performed.
* **TARGET** (required): The object of the action. The ACTION is performed on the target.
    * **TARGET-NAME** (required): The name of the object of the action.
    * **TARGET-SPECIFIERS** (optional): The specifier further identifies the target to some level of precision, such as a specific target, a list of targets, or a class of targets.
    * **TARGET-OPTIONS** (optional): Additional information about how to perform the action for a specific target type.
* **ACTUATOR** (optional): The ACTUATOR may perform the ACTION on the TARGET. The ACTUATOR type will be defined within the context of an Actuator Profile.
    * **ACTUATOR-NAME** (required): The name of the set of functions (e.g., "firewall") performed by the actuator, and the name of the profile defining commands applicable to those functions.
    * **ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS** (optional): The specifier identifies the actuator to some level of precision, such as a specific actuator, a list of actuators, or a group of actuators.
    * **ACTUATOR-OPTIONS** (optional): The options specify how a particular ACTION is to be performed for an actuator type.
* **COMMAND-OPTIONS** (optional): Provide additional information on how the command is to be performed, such as date/time, periodicity, duration etc. COMMAND OPTIONS only influence/ impact the command and are defined independently of any ACTION, ACTUATOR or TARGET.

The TARGET of an OpenC2 Command may include a set of targets of the same type, a range of targets, or a particular target. Specifiers for TARGETs are optional and provide additional precision for the target.

The OpenC2 ACTUATOR field identifies the entity(ies) that execute the ACTION on the TARGET. Specifiers for actuators refine the command so that a particular function, system, class of devices, or specific device can be identified. Actuator-options indicate how an action is to be done in the context of the actuator.

Actuator is optional. One case where the Actuator is not specified is the case if  the transport provides the mutual authentication so the OpenC2 Producer and Consumer both know the Consumer is the Actuator. One example of this would be an https API with mutual authentication. Another  example may be a pub/sub such as OpenDXL.  Another case where the actuator is not specified is when 'effects-based actions' are being used such as across trust boundaries - i.e., the Producer says the effect desired (e.g., deny ip, mitigate domain, etc.) but leaves it up to decision making in the OpenC2 Consumer to determine what actuator to use to achieve the desired effect.

COMMAND-OPTIONS influence the command by providing information such as time, periodicity, duration, or other details on what is to be executed. They can also be used to convey the need for acknowledgement or additional status information about the execution of a command.

### 2.2.2 Action Vocabulary
This section defines the set of OpenC2 actions grouped by their general activity. Table 2-1 summarizes the definition of the OpenC2 actions.

* _Actions that Control Information_: These actions are used to gather information needed to determine the current state or enhance cyber situational awareness.
* _Actions that Control Access_: These actions are used to control traffic flow and file permissions (e.g., allow/deny).
* _Actions that Control Activities/Devices_: These actions are used to control the state or the activity of a system, a process, a connection, a host, or a device. The actions are used to execute tasks, adjust configurations, set and update parameters, and modify attributes.
* _Effects-Based Actions_: Effects-based actions are at a higher level of abstraction for purposes of communicating a desired impact rather than a command to execute specific tasks. This level of abstraction enables coordinated actions between enclaves, while permitting a local enclave to optimize its workflow for its specific environment. Effects-based action assumes that the recipient enclave has a decision-making capability because effects-based actions typically do not have a one-to-one mapping to the other actions.

> **Editor's Note** - This table is largely duplicated in Section 3. The editors plan to defer comments about duplication of tables between Sections 2 and 3 until after enough of the spec is complete to see how to correctly organize it.

| remediate | Task the recipient to eliminate a vulnerability or attack point. |

### 2.2.3 Target Vocabulary
The TARGET is the object of the ACTION (or alternatively, the ACTION is performed on the TARGET). The baseline set of TARGETs is summarized in Table 2-2 and a full description of the targets and their associated specifiers is documented in the property tables (TBSL).

> **Editor's Note** - This table is largely duplicated in Section 3. The editors plan to defer comments about duplication of tables between Sections 2 and 3 until after enough of the spec is complete to see how to correctly organize it.

**Table 2-2. Summary of Targets.**

> **Editor's Note** - There is agreement that targets be extensible. That is, if an implementer has a target that is not yet in the language, the extensibility would be used. Several alternatives are under considerations so the exact text to go here is still under development.

### 2.2.4 Actuator
An ACTUATOR is an implementation of a cyber defense function that executes the ACTION on the TARGET. An Actuator Profile is a specification that identifies the subset of ACTIONS, TARGETS and other aspects of this language specification that are mandatory to implement or optional in the context of a particular ACTUATOR. An Actuator Profile also defines ACTUATOR-SPECIFIERS and ACTUATOR-OPTIONS that are meaningful and possibly unique to the actuator.

An Actuator Profile SHALL be composed in accordance with the framework in section 4.

> **Editor's Note** - TBSL - More text be included in a future iteration (probably iteration 4) prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

### 2.2.5 Command-Option Vocabulary
COMMAND-OPTIONS influence a command and are independent of the TARGET, ACTUATOR and ACTION itself. COMMAND-OPTIONS provide additional information to refine how the command is to be performed such as time, periodicity, or duration, or convey the need for status information such as a response is required. The requested status/information will be carried in a RESPONSE.

Table 2-3 lists the valid command-options.

> **Editor's Note** - This table is largely duplicated in Section 3. The editors plan to defer comments about duplication of tables between Sections 2 and 3 until after enough of the spec is complete to see how to correctly organize it.

**Table 2-3. Summary of Command Options.**

| Command Option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| start_time | The specific date/time to initiate the action |
| stop_time | The specific date/time to terminate the action |
| duration | The length of time for an action to be in effect |
| response_requested | Indicate the type of response required for the action |
| command_id | Uniquely identifies a particular command |

> **Editor's Note** - `command_id` is agreed to be needed. It is still being deliberated whether it is a command option, in a new header section, or as a top-level part of the command peering with action/target/actuator/command-options.

### 2.2.6 Extensibility
> **Editor's Note** - TBSL - This section will be included in a future iteration. 

## 2.3 OpenC2 Response
The OpenC2 Response is a message sent from an entity as the result of a command. Response messages provide acknowledgement, status, results from a query, or other information as requested from the issuer of the command. Response messages are solicited and correspond to a command.

### 2.3.1 Response Structure
The following list summarizes the fields and subfields of an OpenC2 Response. OpenC2 Responses MUST contain an STATUS and MAY contain an STATUS_TEXT and/or RESULTS. OpenC2 is agnostic of any particular serialization; however, implementations MUST support JSON serialization of the responses.

* **STATUS** (required): An integer containing a numerical status code
* **STATUS_TEXT** (optional): A free-form string containing human-readable description of the response status. The string can contain more detail than is represented by the status code, but does not affect the meaning of the response.
* **RESULTS** (optional): Contains the data or extended status code that was requested from an OpenC2 Command. If not present, the status code is a sufficient response.

# 3 OpenC2 Property Tables
## 3.1 Terminology
The syntax of valid OpenC2 messages is defined using the following datatypes:

| Type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Primitive Types** |   |
| Binary | A sequence of octets or bytes. Serialized either as binary data or as a string using an encoding such as hex or base64. |
| Boolean | A logical entity that can have two values: `true` and `false`. Serialized as either integer or keyword. |
| Date-Time | TBD, RFC XXXX |
| Integer | A number that can be written without a fractional component. Serialized either as binary data or a text string. |
| Number | A real number. Valid values include integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. Serialized as either binary data or a text string. |
| String | A sequence of characters. Each character must have a valid Unicode codepoint. |
| **Structures** |   |
| Array | An ordered list of unnamed fields. Each field has an ordinal position and a type.  Serialized as a list. |
| ArrayOf | An ordered list of unnamed fields of the same type. Each field has an ordinal position and must be the specified type. Serialized as a list. |
| Choice | One field selected from a set of named fields. The value has a name and a type. Serialized as a one-element map. |
| Enumerated | A set of id:name pairs. Serialized as either the integer id or the name string. |
| Map | An unordered set of named fields. Each field has a name and a type.  Serialized as a mapping type (referred to in various programming languages as: associative array, dict, dictionary, hash, map, object). |
| Record | An ordered list of named fields, e.g. a message, record, structure, or row in a table. Each field has an ordinal position, a name, and a type. Serialized as either a list or a map. |

Once we have a lot of them (not an issue yet), we may figure out how to just put a reference here to a list maintained by the AP-SC.

> **Editor's Note** - The intent is to for the actuators to be extensible. Ie if a vendor has a function that is not yet in an AP-SC profile, the extensibility would be used to add this new function.  The text to go here on how to do that is still under development

# 4 Foundational Actuator Profile
> **Editor's Note** - TBSL - This section be included in a future iteration (probably iteration 5) prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

# 5 Conformance
OpenC2 is a command and control language that converges (i.e., common 'point of understanding') on a common syntax, and lexicon. Conformant implementations of OpenC2:

* MUST support OpenC2 commands and responses as defined in this document.
* MUST implement the actions designated as mandatory in this document.
* MUST implement the targets designated as mandatory in this document.
* MAY implement optional targets defined in this document
* MAY implement actuator specifiers, actuator options, target specifiers and/or target options as specified in one or more Actuator Profiles.
* MUST implement JSON serialization of the commands and responses that are consistent with the syntax defined in this document.

> **Editor's Note** - TBSL - More conformance text will be included in a future iteration (probably iteration 5) prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

# Appendix C. Acronyms
> **Editor's Note** - TBSL - This section be included in the final iteration prior to submitting for Committee Specification.

# Appendix D. Examples
> **Editor's Note** - TBSL - This section will be populated with examples of json command and responses. The intent is to have each example serve multiple purposes (e.g., one example shows action=allow, command option=start_time, target=....) and then could be referenced with footnotes from several places in spec. This original draft was quite long due to all the inline examples and this is hoped to be a reasonable compromise

Example 1:

* Some TBSL OpenC2 Command in JSON
* Some TBSL OpenC2 Response in JSON

Example 2:

* TBSL
