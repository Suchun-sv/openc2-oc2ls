<p>Members of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/">OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC</a> create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository ( <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-oc2ls">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-oc2ls</a> ) as part of the TC's chartered work (<i>i.e.</i>, the program of work and deliverables described in its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php">charter</a>).</p>

<p>OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS TC Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Purpose statement: Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms, or other aspects of the implementation. The <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2ls/">OpenC2 Language Specification</a> defines the OpenC2 language, and the responsibility for drafting it resides with the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2-lang">OASIS OpenC2 Language Subcommittee (LSC)</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of the creation of this GitHub repository, the OpenC2 Language Specification was at <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2ls/v1.0/csd01/">CSD (Revision) 01</a>. The intent of this repository is to propose and track incremental changes to the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dCommitteeDraft">CSD</a> as it matures through several revisions.  The intent is to use GitHub to track issues (<i>e.g.</i> issues brought by members when reviewing drafts and voting on CSD) and to use individual GitHub commits for change management of proposed changes to the CSD.</p>

<p>GitHub can be used to review individual <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-oc2ls/commits/master">commits</a> (<i>e.g.</i> changes in response to an issue or new text added as it's agreed to by the LSC) and then the commits can be incorporated. Tools exist to support the creation of PDF/HTML/Word documents from the GitHub markdown text in the repository. Editable format Work Product documents in this repository are expected to adhere to the formal specification of "markdown" in the <a href="http://spec.commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> standard.  Markdown has human readable raw text that is simpler and cleaner than HTML or the underlying XML in Word or Google Docs. It also has the advantage of creating simpler, cleaner HTML than Google Docs or Word.</p>

<p>The goals of the repository include:</p>

<ul>

<li>easier for members to review the changes to the CSD as it matures</li>
<li>easier for the editors to create the PDF/HTML/Word versions for official voting</li>
<li>"cleaner" raw text and HTML</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> The OpenC2 Language Subcommittee Co-Chairs (<a href="mailto:duncan@sfractal.com">Duncan Sparrell</a> and <a href="mailto:jdroman@nsa.gov">Jason Romano</a>) <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2823">proposed</a> this GitHub repository as a trial for the language CSD after some experience with the <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-glossary">OpenC2 glossary</a> and some experimentation of their own.</p>
